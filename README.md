# NumberSort
Simple implementation of three sort algorithms: **BubbleSort, SelectionSort and InsertionSort**. 

At beginning the program generates 30 random numbers in a array. After that the user can choose one of three sort algorithms, which
will sort the numbers of the array from smallest to largest. The result of every pass shows in a text area.
